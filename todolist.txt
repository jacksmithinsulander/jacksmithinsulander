Personal todo-notes

1. CSS styling and placing every element how I like it.
2. Potential dropdown menu under "My Work" tag, creating a submenu categorizing my previous work. 
3. Adding a lightmode / darkmode switch (maybe doing it dynamic to the browser settings too)
4. Adding a funicon
5. Adding Icons on the website.
6. IMPORTANT! Make sure to format everything so it's looking consistant. 
7. Also, I should add a picture of myself on the website too.
