Personal todo-notes

1. CSS styling and placing every element how I like it. (Needs to be redone, previous CSS styling got ruined during the process)
2. Potential dropdown menu under "My Work" tag, creating a submenu categorizing my previous work. 
3. Adding a lightmode / darkmode switch(done) (maybe doing it dynamic to the browser settings too(not done))
4. Adding a funicon (done)
5. Adding Icons on the website (done)
6. Make sure to format everything so it's looking consistant. 
7. Also, I should add a picture of myself on the website too. Maybe as an SVG(done, but I will neet to style it)
8. Will also need to add some cache for light/ dark mode. 
9. Need to write the contents on the "about me" page.
