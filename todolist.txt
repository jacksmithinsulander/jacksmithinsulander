Personal todo-notes

1. CSS styling and placing every element how I like it. (kind of done, a lot of more styling to do, also placing elements correctly on the sup domains)
2. Potential dropdown menu under "My Work" tag, creating a submenu categorizing my previous work. 
3. Adding a lightmode / darkmode switch (maybe doing it dynamic to the browser settings too)
4. Adding a funicon (done)
5. Adding Icons on the website.
6. Make sure to format everything so it's looking consistant. 
7. Also, I should add a picture of myself on the website too. Maybe as an SVG
